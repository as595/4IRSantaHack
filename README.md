## Introduction
 Welcome to the 4IR CDT Santa Hack 2018! 

The CDT Christmas hackathon is designed to help you improve your data science skills in a friendly and supportive environment. At the hackathon, you can either work on your own or in a team of up to three people. The hack challenge is to classify the test images as *Santa* or *Not Santa* and the team with the highest accuracy at the end of the hack wins. Simple.

-----

## The Challenge...

There is no single way to win the Santa Hack - you can use whichever machine learning approach you want: SVM, Random Forests, CNNs... and you can extract whatever features you like along the way. The only thing you do have to do is produce a piece of code that classifies the approved Santa Hack test image dataset and (honestly!) reports its accuracy. To help you get started we've provided some classification tutorials as well as a quick tutorial on how to scrape images from google image search in case you want to expand your training data set.

-----

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack/blob/master/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
