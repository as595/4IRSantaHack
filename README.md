## Introduction
 Welcome to the 4IR CDT Santa Hack 2018! 

The CDT Christmas hackathon is designed to help you improve your data science skills in a friendly and supportive environment. At the hackathon, you can either work on your own or in a team of up to three people. The hack challenge is to classify the test images as *Santa* or *Not Santa* and the team with the highest accuracy at the end of the hack wins. Simple.

The hack agenda and instructions for what you might need to bring are [here]().

## The Challenge...

There is no single way to win the Santa Hack - you can use whichever machine learning approach you want: SVM, Random Forests, CNNs... and you can extract whatever features you like along the way. The only thing you do have to do is produce a piece of code that classifies the approved Santa Hack test image dataset and (honestly!) reports its accuracy. To help you get started we've provided some [classification tutorials](https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack/tree/master/tutorials) as well as [a quick tutorial on how to scrape images from google image search](https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack/tree/master/tutorials/webscraping) in case you want to expand your training data set. Deep learning is allowed, but do remember that the hack is time limited!

The Santa Hack was inspired by [this blog](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/04/how-to-create-a-deep-learning-dataset-using-google-images/).

## The Code...

Please make sure you read the code of conduct for the hackathon (and all hackathons). As well as reading it, you are also welcome to re-use it. Ours is adapted from one produced by the [RAS](https://ras.ac.uk), but Github also provides a set of [standard templates](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/) for collaborative coding projects that you might find useful.

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack/blob/master/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
