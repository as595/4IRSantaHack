# 2018 4IR Santa Hack

## Introduction
 Welcome to the [DARA Big Data](https://www.darabigdata.com) project [International Data Week 2018](http://internationaldataweek.org) hackathon at the University of Botswana! <img src="https://github.com/darabigdata/IDWBotswana/blob/master/media/Animated-Flag-Botswana.gif" width=5%>

The DARA Big Data hackathon is designed to help you improve your data science skills in a friendly and supportive environment. At the hackathon, you will be grouped into **teams of four** and each team will choose one of the DARA Big Data hack challenges to work on. At the end of the hack each team will give a 5 minute (3 slide) presentation on the results of their challenge. These presentations will be judged by the organisers and there will be a prize for the winning team. The presentations will be judged on (1) the accuracy of the predicted results via machine learning and (2) visualisation/presentation of the data and results.

The DARA Big Data hack challenges will be run in Python3 using the [IDIA Cloud](idia.ac.za/research-and-projects/african-research-cloud). Students should have a basic working knowledge of Python (including the scipy and numpy libraries) - but you do not have to be an expert to take part and enjoy yourself!

## The Challenge...

Machine Learning can be used to provide awesome applications and services. Examples are recommender systems on Netflix, Amazon and even Google reverse Image search. However, creating an application isn't limited to big tech firms. In this challenge you will build a web application of your choice and we've put together [a tutorial](https://github.com/darabigdata/IDWBotswana/tree/master/CHALLENGE-1) to help you get started, which shows you how to build a movie recommender based on a simple machine learning approach.

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/as595/4IRSantaHack/blob/master/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
