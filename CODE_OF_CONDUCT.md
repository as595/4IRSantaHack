# Code of Conduct for DARA Big Data Hackathons

We value the participation of all our attendees and want you all to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to show respect and courtesy to other fellow attendees and members of the university.

As such, the **DARA Big Data Hackathon** will be a harassment-free event for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, religion. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form.

* Presenters give their time freely, some are very distinguished, some are early career scientists, and all deserve a fair and encouraging hearing. Please try to be on time for the start of a session, or otherwise slip quietly into the room, refrain from loud conversations outside the doors and switch off mobile phones, and when you are using your computer try to do so quietly.
* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
* All communication given by lecturers, organisers and attendees should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language, jokes and imagery are not appropriate for any event.
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
* Respect the venue staff.
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event, without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, respectful space for all.
